# Tailwind Resources

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. This repository intends to gather useful resources to learn and develop beautiful websites using Tailwind.

## UI libraries

Sometimes we want a head start with our Tailwind development. This list provides resources to UI libraries build on top of Tailwind.

- daisyUI, https://daisyui.com/
- Flowbite, https://flowbite.com/

## Headless components

If you don't want a full fledged UI library, you might try a headless UI package. These resources contain unstyled, accessible components that are tricky to build from scratch, with great Tailwind integrations.
